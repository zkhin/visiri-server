Visiri is a react-based app on the client side that allows users to markup a microscopy image. Users take pictures of cells through a microscope and import the picture into the application. The application allows users to manually click on cells within the image to set small rectangular boxes that are used for live/dead cell counts in biological experiments. A viability percentage is calculated and displayed to the user.
The application saves the image and cell counts/box regions to the server where multiple instances of these experiments are saved to an account. In the future, this image and region data will be used to train a convolutional neural network with a region proposal model so cell counts can be automatically performed.
